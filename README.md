#### Notes
> :warning: **Please attention**: as you can see I make publicly available some of my university exam projects, therefore anyone is obviously free of taking ideas from those. Anyway if it will be found that someone is copying the code (in the mean CTRL-C / CTRL-V) for its own project of the *same* exam, they will be reported to the Professor.
